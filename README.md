# DragonLog

DragonLog is a logging program to log hamradio QSOs.
Beside logging for ham radio you can also log CB radio QSOs.

## First start

Before you can start to log QSOs a database has to be selected.
It can be placed on a path where you wish to.
The database is created and initialised.

At the next start of the program the last database gets opened automatically.

You can switch between different databases as you like.

## QSOs

You can log single QSOs by using the shortcut Ctrl+L or 
use a log loop to enter multiple QSOs via Ctrl+Shift+L.

The displayed form can be handled the easiest if you use TAB key to jump from field to field.

If automatic time is selected, the time gets updated at saving the QSO.

## Export and import

Currently only export is supported
* Excel format
* CSV format (Excel style with separator ;)
* ADIF 3.x format (CB QSOs are skipped automatically)
