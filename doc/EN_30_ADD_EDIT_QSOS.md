Add and Edit QSOs
=================

This chapter targets the QSO form only. Using the CassiopeiaConsole will be described in another chapter.

You can log single QSOs by using the shortcut Ctrl+L.

The displayed form can be handled the easiest if you use TAB key to jump from field to field.

The form requires a callsign from your QSO partner and a start date to save/upload the data.
It gives a colourful feedback for the quality of your supplied data.
The colour feedback highlights required and recommended data only.

| Colour                                               | Meaning         |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| <span style="background-color:#ff0000">red</span>    | required        |
| <span style="background-color:#ff7f00">orange</span> | wrong format    |
| <span style="background-color:#ffff00">yellow</span> | empty           |
| <span style="background-color:#00ff00">green</span>  | ok              |
| <span style="background-color:#0000ff">blue</span>   | worked before   |

If automatic time is selected, the end time gets updated at saving the QSO.

QSOs can be edited by double-clicking on an entry in the database view.

In log and change mode there is an extra tab for QSL and different upload status.
Here you can check the status of your paper QSL, eQSL inbox or LoTW QSLs.


### Callbook lookup

The different callbook lookup retrieve locator, QTH and name for a callsign.
If a lookup result is available (internal or external), only empty form fields are filled with this data.

A callsign lookup on the internal callbook happens after typing a callsign. 
On saving the QSO the data gets added to or updated in the internal callbook.

DragonLog can retrieve additional OM data from HamQTH.com, QRZ.com or QRZCQ.com callbook.

Make sure that you properly set the credentials for each online service in the settings.
