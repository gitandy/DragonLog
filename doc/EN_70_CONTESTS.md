Contest, Contest Logs and History
=================================

Only a few contest are currently supported. 
The number will increase as I make progress in contests or someone using this Logger places a feature request.

If you want to log a contest, bring up the Contest Statistics with `Ctrl + T` and select the contest and date.
This will also set the QSO filter of your Logbook to display only this type of contest in the given range of date.
CassiopeiaConsole also will be set to contest mode.

Then you should start to log QSOs with either CassiopeiaConsole (heavily suggested) or via QSO form.

For contests, you do not have to track your sent exchange. DragonLog will care about at export.
So just let the running number increase and care about the received exchange from your QSO partner.

After the contest, use `Contest - Export Contest...` to generate a contest file in the special format (e.g. Cabrillo).
The contest name and dates should be preset in the dialog from the Contest Statistics. These information maybe important, 
as DragonLog may calculate your points or builds your sent exchange out of them.

**Please check the exported file properly before sending it in!!!**


Call History
------------

If a callbook is loaded, the call lookup during a contest is performed against the call history instead 
of the internal callbook.
After typing a callsign the received exchange will be filled with data from the lookup.

After saving a QSO in a running contest, the received exchange data is added to or updated in the call history.
The callbook will also be updated.
